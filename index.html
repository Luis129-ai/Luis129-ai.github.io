    <h4 class="updated-date">Last updated: February 18, 2026</h4>

    <p>Thank you for choosing to play <b>Unlimited Sudoku</b>. As a solo developer, I respect your privacy and am
      comitted
      to being transparent about how this app operates.</p>

    <hr />
    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>My philosophy is simple: <b>I do not collect, store, or have access to any of your personal data.</b> The app is
      designed to function entirely on your device, with minimal external data usage solely for the purpose of enabling
      iCloud sync and processing payments through Apple.</p>

    <h3 class="section-name">Information Collection and Use</h3>
    <p>I want you to understand exactly what data is used within the app:</p>

    <h4>1. iCloud Data</h3>
      <p>To provide a seamless experience across your devices, <b>Unlimited Sudoku</b> uses Apple's built-in iCloud
        service NSUbiquitousKeyValueStore to sync your game state between your iPhone devices signed into
        the same Apple ID.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Who handles this data?</b> This data is transmitted, stored, and processed entirely by Apple. I do not
            operate any servers and cannot access, read, or retrieve this data.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>What is stored?</b> Only non-personal, application specific data. This data is coins collected, reveals
            count, lives count, experience points, avatar, and streak.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>2. In-App Purchases (Subscriptions)</h3>
        <p><b>Unlimited Sudoku</b> offers renewable subscriptions (1 month, 3 months, and 1 year) that removes gameplay
          limitations.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>What I receive:</b> When you purchase a subscription, Apple's notifies <b>Unlimited Sudoku</b> about
              the
              subscription and unlocks the features for you.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>Suscription Data:</b> To manage or cancel your subscription, you must do so through your Apple ID
              account
              settings on your device or going into Settings Tab on <b>Unlimited Sudoku</b> and tapping on <i>Manage
                Subscription</i>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>3. No Data Collection</h3>
          <p>I do not use any third-part analytics tools, advertising frameworks, or tracking software. I do not ask for
            your
            name, email address, or location.</p>

          <h3 class="section-name">Data Sharing with Third Parties</h3>
          <p>I do not sell, trade or transfer any information to outside parties. The only transfer that occurs is
            directly
            between your device and Apple's iCloud servers.</p>

          <h3 class="section-name">Children's Privacy</h3>

            standard of
            privacy.</p>
